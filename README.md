# README


Nameless Chamber was designed as an application with a specific process
for teaching dictation skills through moveable-do solfege. This core concept needs
further functionality and bug-fixing (see list below) and we welcome any help with this
or suggestions for additional functionality.

Under the issues tab in github are also some videos explaining certain bugs

Bugs

Incorrect red notes return to black after clicking check work button. Page is re-rendering entire measure instead of by individual note
Sixteenth note keystroke does not work
Accidentals needs to be carried through the measure
When listening to the audio, the input screen is out of focus
Program saves the previously adjusted octave instead of resetting
Sometimes clicking a navigation button causes screen to scroll down instead of going to a new page
Space-bar keystroke for audio no longer works after page is refreshed for correction
Too many users made site lag. Move to client-side? Node.js?

New Functionality

Keystrokes
Key map needs to be improved and streamlined
Keystrokes for chromatic pitches
Buttons and Pop Ups
Add an Undo button
Have help window stay up until clicked on
Have feedback and all pop-ups be consistent
A reminder button if student tries to log out and has not clicked on final submit
Have an error message if the username or password is incorrect or if the registration key has expired
Sizing and UI
In general, make site more aesthetically pleasing
Scroll bar for the score in all views
Make audio block larger
Get rid of the visual connection where when the cursor moves through pitches on the score it also moves through the solfege in the selection box

Instructor Options

Option for fixed-do rendering
Allow instructor to limit the amount of submits a student can do for each page before they have to do a final submit
Instructor can pre-populate certain parameters, i.e. give students the rhythm and have them just fill out solfege, or
have all the pitches that are "do" show up and students have to fill out the rest.

Miscellaneous

Student gets an email confirmation that final submit has been received
