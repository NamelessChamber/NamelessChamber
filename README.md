# Nameless Chamber

A music dictation web application.

Nameless Chamber was designed as an application with a specific process
for teaching dictation skills through moveable-do solfege. This core concept needs
further functionality and bug-fixing (see list below) and we welcome any help with this
or suggestions for additional functionality.
