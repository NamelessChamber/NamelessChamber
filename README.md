Nameless Chamber was designed as an application with a specific process
for teaching dictation skills through moveable-do solfege. This core concept needs
further functionality and bug-fixing (see list below) and we welcome any help with this
or suggestions for additional functionality.

Please look under the github Issues tab for the most recent bugs, and future
functionality for frontend/backend.


Here is a link if you need to set up a virtual environment for Nameless:
